      You''re set up and running on PostgresML! This is an end-to-end system for training
      and deploying real time machine learning models. It handles data versioning,
      model training and validation, and safe production release. This dashboard web
      app will give you an overview of what''s happening in the system and also helps
      build and deploy projects. You can use notebooks like this one to interact with
      your database in real time and organize your SQL while documenting your code.



      ### Notebooks


      These notebooks are similar to Jupyter Notebooks, which you might be familiar
      with already. On the bottom of the page, you will find a text editor which is
      used to create new cells. Each cell can contain either Markdown which is just
      text really, and SQL which will be executed directly by your Postgres database
      server.


      Each cell has a little menu in the top right corner, allowing you to (re)run
      it (if it''s SQL), edit it, and delete it.



      Let me give you an example. The next cell (cell #2) will be a SQL cell which
      will execute a simple query. Go ahead and click the next "Play" button now.'

      Most organizations have some risks that may be minimized using machine learning,
      by predicting the likelihood of negative outcomes before they happen. As long
      as you''re able to track the information leading up to the unfortunate events,
      there are many different machine learning algorithms that can tease out the
      correlations across multiple variables.


      One example of risk ecommerce companies face is credit card fraud with stolen
      credit cards. When the owner of the card sees charges they never authorized
      on their monthly statement, they''ll report these to the credit card company,
      and the charges will be reversed. The ecommerce company will lose the merchandise
      as well as shipping charges and labor costs. If a company receives too many
      chargebacks, not only will they incur expensive losses, but the credit card
      processors may remove them from the platorm, so it''s important they have some
      certainty about the owner of the cards identity and legitimate interests.


      In this notebook, we''ll demonstrate how a simplified ecommerce application
      might track customer orders, and use machine learning to detect chargeback risks
      in real time during checkout. The most important step in building any Machine
      Learning model is understanding the data. Knowing it''s structure, application
      use, and the full meaning for the business will allow us to create meaningful
      features and labels for our models. In this notebook, we''ve included a fair
      bit of SQL to implement logic that would normally be written at the application
      layer to help you build an intuition about the domain.

      This is a great training set for a machine learning model. We''ve found a feature

      Perishable orders are less likely to result in a chargeback. A good model will

      may never have seen before, like an order that is only 33% perishable goods.

      these are categories like:


      - `True` or `False`

      - `0` or `1`

      - `hot_dog` or `not_hot_dog`


      These categories divide a population into things we care about, and things we
      can ignore. Binary classification is a common task for machine learning models.
      It can be applied across a broad set of scenarios, once you understand the way
      to structure your problem as a set of example data with labeled outcomes.


      In this tutorial, we''ll train models using various "supervised learning" algorithms
      to classify medical samples as benign or malignant. Supervised learning techniques
      require us to label the sample data for the algorithm to learn how the inputs
      correlate with the labels. After the algorithm has been trained on the labeled
      data set we created, we can present it with new unlabeled data to classify based
      on the most likely outcome.


      As we saw in [Tutorial 1: Real Time Fraud Model](../1/) understanding the structure
      of the data and the labels is a complex and critical step for real world machine
      learning projects. In this example we''ll focus more on the different algorithms,
      and use an academic benchmark dataset that already includes binary labels from
      UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin. Features were computed from a digitized image
      of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics
      of the cell nuclei present in the image. The labels are either True for a malginant
      sample of False for a benign sample.

      There are thousands of different pre-trained translation models between language
      pairs. They generally take a single input string in the "from" language, and
      translate it into the "to" language as a result of the call. PostgresML transformations
      provide a batch interface where you can pass an array of `TEXT` to process in
      a single call for efficiency. Not all language pairs have a default task name
      like this example of English to French. In those cases, you''ll need to specify
      [the desired model](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=translation)
      by name. Because this is a batch call with 2 inputs, we''ll get 2 outputs in

      Sentiment analysis is one use of `text-classification`, but there are [many
      others](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-classification). This model returns
      both a label classification `["POSITIVE", "NEUTRAL", "NEGATIVE"]`, as well as
      the score where 0.0 is perfectly negative, and 1.0 is perfectly positive. This
      example demonstrates specifying the `model` to be used rather than the task.
      The [`roberta-large-mnli`](https://huggingface.co/roberta-large-mnli) model
      specifies the task of `sentiment-analysis` in it''s default configuration, so
      we may omit it from the parameters. Because this is a batch call with 2 inputs,
      we''ll get 2 outputs in the JSONB.


      See [text classification documentation](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-classification)
      for more options and potential use cases beyond sentiment analysis. You''ll
      notice the outputs are not great in this example. RoBERTa is a breakthrough
      model, that demonstrated just how important each particular hyperparameter is
      for the task and particular dataset regardless of how large your model is. We''ll

      ARRAY['\n            Dominic Cobb is the foremost practitioner of the artistic
      science \n            of extraction, inserting oneself into a subject''s dreams
      to \n            obtain hidden information without the subject knowing, a concept
      \n            taught to him by his professor father-in-law, Dr. Stephen Miles.
      \n            Dom''s associates are Miles'' former students, who Dom requires
      \n            as he has given up being the dream architect for reasons he \n
      \           won''t disclose. Dom''s primary associate, Arthur, believes it \n
      \           has something to do with Dom''s deceased wife, Mal, who often \n
      \           figures prominently and violently in those dreams, or Dom''s want
      \n            to \"go home\" (get back to his own reality, which includes two
      \n            young children). Dom''s work is generally in corporate espionage.
      \n            As the subjects don''t want the information to get into the wrong
      \n            hands, the clients have zero tolerance for failure. Dom is also
      a \n            wanted man, as many of his past subjects have learned what Dom
      \n            has done to them. One of those subjects, Mr. Saito, offers Dom
      a \n            job he can''t refuse: to take the concept one step further into
      \n            inception, namely planting thoughts into the subject''s dreams
      \n            without them knowing. Inception can fundamentally alter that \n
      \           person as a being. Saito''s target is Robert Michael Fischer, the
      \n            heir to an energy business empire, which has the potential to
      \n            rule the world if continued on the current trajectory. Beyond
      the \n            complex logistics of the dream architecture of the case and
      some \n            unknowns concerning Fischer, the biggest obstacles in success
      for \n            the team become worrying about one aspect of inception which
      Cobb \n            fails to disclose to the other team members prior to the
      job, and \n            Cobb''s newest associate Ariadne''s belief that Cobb''s
      own \n            subconscious, especially as it relates to Mal, may be taking
      over \n            what happens in the dreams.\n        ']\n    ) AS result;"
